Brief Problem Decomposition:

    1. Get blood glucose (BG) level in mg/dL
        a. Get target BG
    2. Get ketone level and assign each level to a multiplier
    3. Get number of carbs
    4. Calculate BG correction
    5. Get insulin-to-carb ratio (1 unit : x carbs)
    6. Calculate insulin required based on BG, ketones, carbs, and ICR
    7. Print units of insulin required



Formulae:

    (4) Blood sugar level correction = (BG - target BG) / correction factor

    (6) Insulin required = (carbs / ICR + Blood sugar level correction) * ketone multiplier
